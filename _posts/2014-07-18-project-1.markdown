description: A comprehensive analysis of main-sequence stars with rotation periods exceeding 30 days using Kepler SAP light curves. We developed a systematic approach combining light curve pre-processing, advanced period detection algorithms, and rigorous candidate selection criteria. Our method successfully identified over 1000 long-period rotators, including 165 newly discovered systems, significantly expanding our understanding of stellar rotation in the slow-rotation regime.
