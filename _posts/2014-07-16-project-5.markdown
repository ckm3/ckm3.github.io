description: Large-scale statistical analysis of substellar companions using multi-epoch radial velocity, Gaia astrometry, and direct imaging data for 5,108 AFGKM stars. Our novel analysis pipeline identified 167 cold gas giants and 68 brown dwarf companions, revealing a pronounced brown dwarf desert around 40 Jupiter masses. The study demonstrates that binary fraction follows a power-law distribution beyond 3 AU, similar to single stars, indicating no multiplicity preference for brown dwarf formation.
