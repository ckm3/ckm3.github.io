description: Novel deep learning framework for automated classification of astronomical light curves using weakly supervised object detection. Our model automatically identifies optimal analysis windows in both time and frequency domains, enabling feature extraction across multiple scales and sampling intervals. Trained on diverse datasets from space-based and ground-based observations, the framework achieves 87% accuracy for variable stars and transient classification. The model demonstrates excellent transferability across different surveys without requiring retraining.
