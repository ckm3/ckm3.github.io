description: Development of a novel convolutional neural network architecture for automated detection of planetary transits in photometric time series. Our method, based on proven computer vision frameworks, achieves 94% precision and 95% recall for transits with signal-to-noise ratios above 6. The algorithm significantly reduces false positive rates compared to traditional detection methods and has been successfully applied to Kepler and TESS datasets.
