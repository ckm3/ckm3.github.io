description: Comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic, asteroseismic, and evolutionary analysis of the Algol-type eclipsing binary KIC 12268220. Our study reveals a complex system containing a δ Scuti pulsating star and an evolved low-mass secondary (~0.23 M☉). Evolutionary modeling suggests the secondary is in a protohelium white dwarf phase, representing a transitional state similar to R CMa-type systems that may evolve into EL CVn binaries.
